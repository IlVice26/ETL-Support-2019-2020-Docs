## 1 Introduction
##### The purpose of this is to descrive the architecture of the ETL programm project in a way that addresses the interests and concerns of all major stakeholders.
&nbsp;
## 2 Design Goals 
##### Our design was meant to be less difficult and faster for us developers  so our priorities are:
- ##### Write the code in python (language taught by our teacher).
- ##### Be easy to code in a team of 4/5 people where all of us can review and optimize the code going on.
- ##### Be self working because our porgram is meant to work by itself without users.

## 3 Logical View
##### logical view of what our programm will interact.
