## Objectives
The main purpose of this initial iteration is to plan and create a first working prototype of the python script. It must be able to connect and perform the first simple operations on the databases, efficiency it's not required. It was also requested to implement a logging system, in order to make the whole process more understandable, especially in case of mistakes.
At the end of this first iteration the system should be able to:
- Connect to the server through data provided by a json file.
- Taking, processing and returning data from a database to a newer one.
- Have a simple and user-friendly GUI (even if from CLI).
- Save every process executed by the program on a .log file.

## Objectives
This version of code will first have to work with MarconiTT's API to connect to the server and the databases. Obviously the connection method of the last iteration will have to work without problems anyway. The program will also need to be much more efficient and for this reason it will mainly be necessary to change the queries that are executed on the database.
At the end of this iteration the system should be able to:
- Rework the whole app to work with the API.
- Connect to the API and grab the data needed provided by the API.
- Save, process and enter data into the target database.
- Greatly improve the processing and uploading of data from .csv files to the SQL server via queries.
- Recognize and fix all the faults in the code.
